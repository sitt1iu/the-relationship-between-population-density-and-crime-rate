# the-relationship-between-population-density-and-crime-rate

## Introduction

This application investigates whether a relationship exists between population density and crime rate. According to modern psychology, high population density can increase interpersonal friction and elevate the risk of negative emotions. To explore this, the application extracts data from reliable sources and analyzes whether crime rates are associated with population density.

This application uses data from European countries due to its accessibility and consistency. Crime rate data is sourced from the European Commission, and population density data is obtained from the World Bank Group.

Both population density and crime rate are visualized using Plotly Express in the form of interactive maps. The correlation between the two variables is illustrated with a scatter plot. The results indicate no strong relationship between population density and crime rate.
